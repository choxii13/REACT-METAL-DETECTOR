1. In my first API,  I'm using **_json-server --watch  data/ObjectImage.json -p 5001_** for fixed images in the first page.
2. In my second API , I'm using  **_json-server --watch data/ObjectTable.json -p 5001_** for saving the images and making a table.
3. Same as deleting data in _ObjectTable.json -p 5001_.
4. Applying the react function for my detector in the first project.
5. It has an error for saving, because react wont save it, if it is already have the same id.
